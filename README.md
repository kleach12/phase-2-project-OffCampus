<h1>OffCampus<h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
OffCampus is a single page web application that allows for students to find off-campus housing within a close distance of their school. This app will also give a list of information about the housing including amenities, pricing and more. Not only will students be able to use it but there will be a form that complexes will be able to submit a for their own complex adding it to the list.


<h2>Visuals</h2>
Visuals will be updated.


<h2>Roadmap</h2>
The future of this project would to be to add a backend using ruby. 
Also I would liek to expand this project with more components, for example onme that had a map with the locations marked so users can have an idea of where the complex is located.
