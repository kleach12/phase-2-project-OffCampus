This app will also give a list of information about housing including amenities, pricing, and more.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
The future of this project would to be to add a backend using Ruby. 
I would also like to expand this project with more components. For example, I would like to include a map with the locations marked so users can have an idea of where the complex is located.
